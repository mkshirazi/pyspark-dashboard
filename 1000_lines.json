In this study, we report performance test results of two different electrospun conductive nanofiber webs, and three metal plated fabrics. We evaluated contact impedance, step response, noise and signal fidelity performance indices for all five dry electrodes, and compared them to those of conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes. Overall, we found nanofiber web electrodes matched Ag/AgCl electrode performance more closely than metal plated fabric electrodes, with the contact resistance and capacitance of Ag plated PVDF nanofiber web electrodes being most similar to Ag/AgCl over the 10 Hz to 500 kHz frequency range. We also observed that step responses of all three metal-plated fabrics were poorer than those for nanofiber web electrodes and Ag/AgCl. Further, noise standard deviation and noise power spectral densities were generally lower in nanofiber web electrodes than metal plated fabrics; and waveform fidelity of ECG-like traces recorded from nanofiber web electrodes was higher than for metal plated fabrics.

These attacks are somewhat restricted by Automated Turing Tests (ATTs, e.g., captcha challenges) that attempt to mandate human assistance. ATTs are not very difficult for legitimate users, but always pose an inconvenience. Several current ATT implementations are also found to be vulnerable to improved image processing algorithms. ATTs can be made more complex for automated software, but that is limited by the trade-off between user-friendliness and effectiveness of ATTs. As attackers gain control of large-scale botnets, relay the challenge to legitimate users at compromised websites, or even have ready access to cheap, sweat-shop human solvers for defeating ATTs, online guessing attacks are becoming a greater security risk. Using deception techniques (as in honeypots), we propose the user-verifiable authentication scheme (Uvauth) that tolerates, instead of detecting or counteracting, guessing attacks. Uvauth provides access to all authentication attempts; the correct password enables access to a legitimate session with valid user data, and all incorrect passwords lead to fake sessions.

The initial retrieval set can, however, contain a great deal of noise. In this paper, we present a cluster-based resampling method to select novel pseudo-relevant documents based on Lavrenko's relevance model approach. The main idea is to use overlapping clusters to find dominant documents for the initial retrieval set, and to repeatedly use these documents to emphasize the core topics of a query. The proposed resampling method can skip some documents in the initial high-ranked documents and deterministically construct overlapping clusters as sampling units. The hypothesis behind using overlapping clusters is that a good representative document for a query may have several nearest neighbors with high similarities, participating in several different clusters. Experimental results on large-scale web TREC collections show significant improvements over the baseline relevance model. To justify the proposed approach, we examine the relevance density and redundancy ratio of feedback documents. A higher relevance density will result in greater retrieval accuracy, ultimately approaching true relevance feedback. The resampling approach shows higher relevance density than the baseline relevance model on all collections, resulting in better retrieval accuracy in pseudo-relevance feedback.", "cso_syntactic_topics": ["deterministic", "relevance feedback", "pseudo relevance feedback", "retrieval performance", "relevance models", "k-nearest neighbors", "cluster head"], "urls": ["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2013.01.001", "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030645731300006X", "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030645731300006X"], "cso_semantic_topics": ["deterministic", "text document", "relevance feedback", "retrieval performance", "pseudo relevance feedback", "k-nearest neighbors"], "id": 1997294177, "journame": "information processing and management", "cso_enhanced_topics": ["deterministic", "relevance feedback", "retrieval performance", "pseudo relevance feedback", "relevance models", "text document", "k-nearest neighbors", "cluster head", "stochastic", "content based retrieval", "feedback systems", "information retrieval systems", "natural language processing", "computational linguistics", "query expansion", "language model", "information retrieval", "text mining", "clustering algorithms", "sensor nodes", "stochastic processes", "stochasticity", "image retrieval", "multimedia systems", "computer systems", "database systems", "artificial intelligence", "natural languages", "search engines", "query languages", "computer science", "text processing", "data mining", "sensors", "probability", "numerical model", "pattern recognition", "image segmentation", "image enhancement", "internet", "linguistics", "semantics", "world wide web", "computer hardware", "mathematics", "machine learning", "image analysis", "image processing", "computer imaging and vision"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ipm.2013.01.001", "authors": [{"country": "South Korea", "affiliation": "Jeonbuk National University", "name": "kyungsoon lee", "id": 2103478774, "gridid": "grid.411545.0", "affiliationid": 80611190, "order": 1}, {"country": "United States", "affiliation": "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "name": "w bruce croft", "id": 2127889770, "gridid": "grid.266683.f", "affiliationid": 24603500, "order": 2}], "cso_annotated": true, "grid_type": {"education": 100.0}, "type": "academia", "countries": {"south korea": 50.0, "united states": 50.0}, "citation_for_year": [{"citationcount": 5, "year": "2014-01-01"}, {"citationcount": 1, "year": "2015-01-01"}, {"citationcount": 5, "year": "2016-01-01"}, {"citationcount": 2, "year": "2017-01-01"}, {"citationcount": 1, "year": "2018-01-01"}, {"citationcount": 1, "year": "2019-01-01"}]}

The finite blocklength regime is investigated and it is demonstrated that even for moderate blocklengths, it is possible to construct capacity-achieving codes that tolerate exponential level of asynchronism and experience only a rather small loss in rate compared to the perfectly synchronized setting; in particular, the channel dispersion does not suffer any degradation due to asynchronism.

Kernel methods versions can handle structured data, such as trees, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. However kernelized versions of Online Learning algorithms slow down when the number of support vectors becomes large. The traditional way to cope with this problem is introducing budgets that set the maximum number of support vectors. In this paper, we investigate Distributed Trees (DT) as an efficient way to use structured data in online learning. DTs effectively embed the huge feature space of the tree fragments into small vectors, so enabling the use of linear versions of kernel machines over tree structured data. We experiment with the Passive-Aggressive (PA) algorithm by comparing the linear and the kernelized version.

We contrast our findings with data taken from traditional software inspection conducted on a Lucent project and from open source software peer review on six projects, including Apache, Linux, and KDE. Our measures of interest include the review interval, the number of developers involved in review, and proxy measures for the number of defects found during review. We find that despite differences among projects, many of the characteristics of the review process have independently converged to similar values which we think indicate general principles of code review practice. We also introduce a measure of the degree to which knowledge is shared during review. This is an aspect of review practice that has traditionally only had experiential support. Our knowledge sharing measure shows that conducting peer review increases the number of distinct files a developer knows about by 66% to 150% depending on the project.

Existing methods usually try different edit-distance thresholds and select an appropriate threshold to find top-k answers. However it is rather expensive to select an appropriate threshold. To address this problem, we propose a progressive framework by improving the traditional dynamic-programming algorithm to compute edit distance.

These edges lead to strong ringing artifacts when depth maps are coded with DCT-based transform codecs, such as AVC or its successor HEVC.

First, the derivation uses complex fuzzy relations; hence, it assumes the existence of complex fuzzy sets. Second, current theory is based on a restricted polar representation of complex fuzzy proposition, where only one component of a complex fuzzy proposition carries fuzzy information. In this chapter we present a novel form of complex fuzzy logic. The new theory, referred to as generalized complex fuzzy logic, overcomes the limitations of the current theory and provides several advantages. First, the derivation of the new theory is based on axiomatic approach and does not assume the existence of complex fuzzy sets or complex fuzzy classes. Second, the new form supports Cartesian and polar representation of complex logical propositions with two components of fuzzy information. Hence, the new form significantly improves the expressive power and inference capability of complex fuzzy logic. Finally, the new form is compatible with (yet independent of) the definition of complex fuzzy classes; thereby providing further improvement in the expressive power and inference capability. The chapter surveys the current state of complex fuzzy sets, complex fuzzy classes, and complex fuzzy logic; and provides a new and generalized complex fuzzy propositional logic theory. The new theory has potential for usage in advanced complex fuzzy logic systems and latent for extension into multidimensional fuzzy propositional and predicate logic. Moreover, it can be used for inference with type 2 (or higher) fuzzy sets.

The second component will present a novel algorithm for solving problems with large branching factors with application to the challenging problem of Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA). The third component will cover bounded suboptimal external search for practical MSA applications.

It is well known that intra-coded I-frames can be used at switch boundaries to facilitate stream-switching. However, the size of an I-frame is large, making frequent insertion impractical. A recent proposal towards a more efficient stream-switching mechanism is distributed source coding (D-SC), which exploits worst-case correlation between a set of potential predictor frames in the decoder buffer (called side information (SI) frames) and a target frame to lower encoding rate. However, the conventional use of bit-plane and channel coding means the encoding and decoding complexity of DSC frames is large. In this paper, we pursue a novel approach to the stream-switching problem based on the concept of \u201csignal merging\u201d, using piecewise constant (p-wc) function as the merge operator. Specifically, we propose a new merge mode for a code block, where for each k-th transform coefficient in the block, we encode appropriate step size and horizontal shift parameters at the encoder, so that the resulting floor function at the decoder can map corresponding coefficients from any SI frame to the same reconstructed value, resulting in an identically merged signal. The selection of shift parameter per coefficient, as well as coding modes between intra and merge per block, are optimized in a rate-distortion (RD) optimal manner. Experiments show encouraging coding gain over a previous implementation of DSC frame at low-to mid-bitrates at reduced computation complexity.", "conferenceseriesid": 1163163559, "confplace": "Melbourne, Australia", "cso_syntactic_topics": ["channel coding", "rate distortions", "step size", "viewpoint", "bandwidth", "coding mode", "video streams", "frames", "decoding complexity", "coding gains", "streaming applications", "3d scenes", "source coding"], "urls": ["http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icip/icip2013.html#DaiCCOA13"], "cso_semantic_topics": ["rate distortions", "frames", "video streams", "data stream", "streaming applications", "bit rates", "bandwidth", "viewpoint", "channel coding", "step size", "coding gains"], "confseriesname": "International Conference on Image Processing", "id": 1982374380, "cso_enhanced_topics": ["rate distortions", "step size", "3d scenes", "viewpoint", "bit rates", "bandwidth", "source coding", "coding mode", "video streams", "frames", "decoding complexity", "data stream", "streaming applications", "coding gains", "channel coding", "image communication systems", "signal distortion", "visual communication", "imaging systems", "adaptive filters", "three dimensional computer graphics", "software architecture", "video processing", "computer networks", "signal encoding", "data compression", "mode decision", "macro block", "video streaming", "structural frames", "iterative decoding", "block codes", "data mining", "data communication systems", "database systems", "acoustic streaming", "multiprocessing systems", "embedded systems", "image coding", "rayleigh fading", "bit error rate", "fading channels", "channel capacity", "image compression", "image reconstruction", "communication channels (information theory)", "signal to noise ratio", "adaptive algorithms", "adaptive filtering", "computer imaging and vision", "software design", "computer science", "programming theory", "video coding", "coding efficiency", "h.264/avc", "motion estimation", "multimedia systems", "hidden markov models", "markov random fields", "hidden markov model (hmm)", "information theory", "computer systems", "videotex", "parallel processing systems", "microprocessor chips", "image processing", "probability", "image quality", "image analysis", "wireless telecommunication systems", "signal processing", "software", "software engineering", "computer programming languages", "motion compensation", "internet", "markov processes", "image segmentation", "communication", "distributed systems", "computer hardware", "mathematics", "communication systems", "telecommunication systems", "engineering", "computer programming", "correlation analysis", "distributed computer systems"], "doi": "10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738368", "authors": [{"country": "Singapore", "affiliation": "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "name": "ngaiman cheung", "id": 2112309615, "gridid": "grid.263662.5", "affiliationid": 152815399, "order": 3}, {"country": "United States", "affiliation": "Cornell University", "name": "gene cheung", "id": 2142416800, "gridid": "grid.5386.8", "affiliationid": 205783295, "order": 2}, {"country": "United States", "affiliation": "University of Southern California", "name": "antonio ortega", "id": 2118429164, "gridid": "grid.42505.36", "affiliationid": 1174212, "order": 4}, {"country": "China", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "name": "oscar c au", "id": 2939208621, "gridid": "grid.24515.37", "affiliationid": 200769079, "order": 5}, {"country": "China", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "name": "wei dai", "id": 2293823628, "gridid": "grid.24515.37", "affiliationid": 200769079, "order": 1}], "cso_annotated": true, "grid_type": {"education": 100.0}, "type": "academia", "countries": {"singapore": 20.0, "united states": 40.0, "china": 40.0}, "citation_for_year": [{"citationcount": 1, "year": "2013-01-01"}, {"citationcount": 3, "year": "2014-01-01"}, {"citationcount": 0, "year": "2015-01-01"}, {"citationcount": 3, "year": "2016-01-01"}]}

Einerseits bietet der Adapter die Kommunikation mit den Octave-Anwendungen an. Hierfur wird ein Web Service zur Beschreibung der Funktionalitaten bei ihren Anwendungen erstellt. Andererseits stellt er einen weiteren Web Service fur den Client zur Verfugung.\r\nWeiterhin wird ein BEPL-Prozess mit Hilfe des Octave Adapters aufgebaut.

Daher werden\r\nseit langer Zeit Nutzertests zur subjektiven Qualitatsbewertung\r\ndurchgefuhrt. Deren Ziel uber den gesamten Entwcklungsprozesses ist es, die\r\nkritischen Komponenten des Systems mit so wenig wie moglich wahrnehmbarem\r\nEinfluss auf diewahrgenommene Qualitat des Nutzers zu optimieren. Bereits\r\nseit den 1970er Jahren werden hierfur Leitfaden verschiedener\r\nStandardisierungsgremien zur Verfugung gestellt, in denen unterschiedliche\r\nEvaluationsmethoden definiert sind, um die wahrgenommene Gesamtqualitat des\r\nSystems mit Hilfe von Skalen quantitativ evaluieren zu konnen. Aktuelle\r\nAnsatze erweitern diese klassische Methoden um Sichtweise, die uber die\r\nklassische Evaluation hedonistischer Gesamtqualitat hinausgehen, um das\r\nWissen uber individuell zugrundeliegende Qualitatsfaktoren zu erweitern.Die\r\nvorliegende Dissertation verfolgt dabei zwei Ziele. Zum einen soll eine\r\naudiovisuelle Evaluationsmethode entwickelt werden, die eine kombinierte\r\nAnalyse quantitativer und qualitativer Daten ermoglicht, um eine\r\nVerknupfung hedonistischer Qualitat und zugrundeliegender Qualitatsfaktoren\r\nzu ermoglichen. Weiter soll diese Methode innerhalb des Gebiets der mobiler\r\n3DTV-Systeme erprobt und validiert werden.Open Profiling of Quality (OPQ)\r\nals Evaluationsmethode kombiniert quantitative Evaluation wahrgenommener\r\nGesamtqualitat und deskriptive, sensorische Analyse zur Erhebung\r\nindividueller Qualitatsfaktoren. Die Methode ist fur Erhebungen mit naiven\r\nProbanden geeignet. OPQ wurde unter besonderer Beachtung von Validitat und\r\nReliabilitat in einem konstruktivem Ansatz entwickelt und in einer Folge\r\nvon Studien wahrend der Entwicklung eines mobilem 3DTV-Systems mit uber 300\r\nProbanden angewendet. Die Ergebnisse dieser Studien unterstreichen die sich\r\nerganzenden Ergebnisse quantitativer und sensorischer Analysen.Neben der\r\nEntwicklung von OPQ werden in der vorliegenden Arbeit weitere Ansatze\r\nsensorischer Analyse prasentiert und miteinander verglichen.

First, the tertiary structures of monosaccharides are complex merely by virtue of their exceptionally high number of chiral centers. In addition, their electronic characteristics lead to molecular geometries and electrostatic landscapes that can be challenging to predict and model. The monosaccharide units can also interconnect in many ways, resulting in a large number of possible oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, both linear and branched. These larger structures contain a number of rotatable bonds, meaning they potentially sample an enormous conformational space. This article briefly reviews the history of carbohydrate force fields, examining and comparing their challenges, forms, philosophies, and development strategies.

If the N-1-th address is verified, an operating part(130) calculates the maximally used memory size based on a memory size corresponding to the N-1-th address.", "cso_syntactic_topics": ["software"], "urls": ["https://lens.org/129-127-413-148-422"], "cso_semantic_topics": ["random access memory", "software", "non-volatile memories", "cache memory", "memory controller"], "id": 2857569916, "cso_enhanced_topics": ["non-volatile memories", "random access memory", "software", "cache memory", "memory controller", "flash memory", "random access storage", "computer science", "microprocessor chips", "memory architecture", "memory access", "dynamic random access storage", "embedded systems", "parallel processing systems", "computer hardware", "field programmable gate arrays (fpga)", "multi core", "parallel architectures", "computer systems", "distributed systems", "program processors", "distributed computer systems"], "doi": "", "authors": [{"name": "jeong tae young", "id": 2813980746, "order": 1}], "cso_annotated": true, "citation_for_year": [{"citationcount": 1, "year": "2016-01-01"}]}

Successful treatment with a revision Eden-Hybinette procedure, by both an open and arthroscopic approach using screws to secure the bone graft, has previously been reported. However, both the open and arthroscopic approach have required careful dissection through the distorted soft-tissue anatomy in the anterior compartment in front of subscapularis to gain access to the front of the glenoid through a muscle split. In this article, we describe a modification of an arthroscopic Eden-Hybinette technique that is undertaken intra-articularly and only requires portals through the rotator interval. This technique avoids having to undertake any extra-articular dissection in the anterior compartment and can address potential problems with retained metalwork and pre-existing anchor voids within the glenoid. In this Technical Note, we describe and highlight the pearls and pitfalls of an all\u2013intra-articular arthroscopic revision Eden-Hybinette procedure.", "cso_syntactic_topics": [], "urls": ["https://www.arthroscopytechniques.org/article/S2212-6287(18)30170-1/fulltext", "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212628718301701"], "cso_semantic_topics": ["node failure", "combinatorial problems", "combinatorial optimization", "time windows", "information systems"], "id": 2910112275, "journame": "arthroscopy techniques", "cso_enhanced_topics": ["combinatorial optimization", "time windows", "information systems", "combinatorial problems", "node failure", "optimization", "routing algorithms", "computer systems", "combinatorial mathematics", "sensor networks", "wireless sensor networks", "fault tolerance", "mathematics", "computer networks", "computer science", "graph theory", "routers", "wireless telecommunication systems", "embedded systems", "sensors", "wireless communications", "energy utilization", "sensor nodes", "software quality", "fault tolerant computer systems", "theoretical computer science", "telecommunication traffic", "bandwidth", "communication systems", "telecommunication systems", "computer hardware", "electricity", "software design", "distributed computer systems", "telecommunication networks", "engineering", "software engineering"], "doi": "10.1016/j.eats.2018.10.005", "authors": [{"country": "United Kingdom", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "name": "alex mulligan", "id": 2951043066, "gridid": "grid.5335.0", "affiliationid": 241749, "order": 2}, {"country": "United Kingdom", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "name": "graham tytherleighstrong", "id": 2296067373, "gridid": "grid.5335.0", "affiliationid": 241749, "order": 1}], "cso_annotated": true, "grid_type": {"education": 100.0}, "type": "academia", "countries": {"united kingdom": 100.0}, "citation_for_year": [{"citationcount": 1, "year": "2019-01-01"}, {"citationcount": 1, "year": "2020-01-01"}]}

Their strong demands for low-latency or real-time services make Spark, an in-memory big data computing framework, the best choice in taking place of previous disk-based big data computing. As an in-memory framework, reasonable data arrangement in storage is the key factor of performance. However, the existing cache replacement strategy and storage selection mechanism based optimizations all rely on an imprecise available memory model and will lead to negative decision. To address this issue, we propose an available memory model to capture the accurate information of to be freed memory space by sensing the dependencies between the data. And we also propose a maximum memory requirement model for execution prediction to exclude the redundancy from inactive blocks. With such two models, we build DASS, a dependency-aware storage selection mechanism for Spark to make dynamic and fine-grained storage decision.

However, potential contributors must first overcome joining barriers forcing casually committed contributors to spend days or weeks onboarding and thereby reducing participation. To more effectively harness potential contributions from the crowd, we propose a method for programming in which work occurs entirely through microtasks, offering contributors short, self-contained tasks such as implementing part of a function or updating a call site invoking a function to match a change made to the function. In microtask programming, microtasks involve changes to a single artifact, are automatically generated as necessary by the system, and nurture quality through iteration. A study examining the feasibility of microtask programming to create small programs found that developers were able to complete 1008 microtasks, onboard and submit their first microtask in less than 15 minutes, complete all types of microtasks in less than 5 minutes on average, and create 490 lines of code and 149 unit tests. The results demonstrate the potential feasibility as well as revealing a number of important challenges to address to successfully scale microtask programming to larger and more complex programs.", "cso_syntactic_topics": ["software", "open source software"], "urls": ["http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=8331909"], "cso_semantic_topics": ["programming languages", "software", "open source software", "software development", "parallel programming"], "id": 2988668413, "journame": "ieee transactions on software engineering", "cso_enhanced_topics": ["parallel programming", "software development", "software", "programming languages", "open source software", "program processors", "parallel algorithms", "parallel architectures", "computer programming languages", "software project", "software architecture", "computer science", "linguistics", "parallel processing systems", "microprocessor chips", "computer programming", "software design", "distributed systems", "computer hardware", "software engineering", "distributed computer systems", "computer systems"], "doi": "10.1109/TSE.2018.2823327", "authors": [{"country": "United States", "affiliation": "University of California, Irvine", "name": "andre van der hoek", "id": 2136863642, "gridid": "grid.266093.8", "affiliationid": 204250578, "order": 5}, {"country": "United States", "affiliation": "George Mason University", "name": "thomas d latoza", "id": 168727994, "gridid": "grid.22448.38", "affiliationid": 162714631, "order": 1}, {"country": "Germany", "affiliation": "Robert Bosch (Germany)", "name": "fabio ricci", "id": 2224809554, "gridid": "grid.6584.f", "affiliationid": 889804353, "order": 3}, {"name": "arturo di lecce", "id": 2671648027, "order": 2}, {"country": "United States", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "name": "w ben towne", "id": 2093547146, "gridid": "grid.147455.6", "affiliationid": 74973139, "order": 4}], "cso_annotated": true, "grid_type": {"education": 75.0, "company": 25.0}, "type": "collaborative", "countries": {"united states": 75.0, "germany": 25.0}, "dbpedia_categories": ["Conglomerate (company)"], "industrial_sectors": ["management"], "citation_for_year": [{"citationcount": 2, "year": "2019-01-01"}]}

Social Network Analysis (SNA) has played an important role in reducing criminal activities (e.g., counter terrorism) via detecting the influential users in such networks. There are various popular measures to quantify how influential or central any vertex is in a network. As expected, strategic and influential miscreants in covert networks would try to hide herself and her partners (called \\em leaders ) from being detected via these measures by introducing new edges. Waniek et al. show that the corresponding computational problem, called Hiding Leader, is NP Complete for the degree and closeness centrality measures. We study the popular core centrality measure and show that the problem is NP Complete even when the core centrality of every leader is only 3. On the contrary, we prove that the problem becomes polynomial time solvable for the degree centrality measure if the degree of every leader is bounded above by any constant. We then focus on the optimization version of the problem and show that the Hiding Leader problem admits a 2 factor approximation algorithm for the degree centrality measure. We complement it by proving that one cannot hope to have any (2-epsilon) factor approximation algorithm for any constant $epsilon>0$ unless there is a epsilon/2 factor polynomial time algorithm for the Densest k-Subgraph problem which would be considered a significant breakthrough. We empirically establish that our 2 factor approximation algorithm frequently finds out a near optimal solution. On the contrary, for the core centrality measure, we show that the Hiding Leader problem does not admit any (1-alpha) ln n factor approximation algorithm for any constant alpha in (0,1) unless P=NP even when the core centrality of every leader is only 3. Hence, our work shows that, although classical complexity theoretic framework fails to shed any light on relative difficulty of Hiding Leader for different centrality measures, the problem is significantly \"harder'' for the core centrality measure than the degree centrality one.", "conferenceseriesid": 1168671587, "confplace": "Montreal, Canada", "cso_syntactic_topics": ["approximation algorithms", "network analysis", "social networks", "social network analysis", "polynomial-time algorithms", "degree centrality", "centrality measures", "optimization", "optimal solutions", "sna"], "urls": ["https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3331749", "http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/atal/aamas2019.html#DeyM19"], "cso_semantic_topics": ["social networks", "network analysis", "social network analysis", "sna", "betweenness", "centrality measures", "degree centrality", "optimization", "approximation algorithms", "polynomial-time algorithms"], "confseriesname": "Adaptive Agents and Multi-Agents Systems", "id": 2962980933, "cso_enhanced_topics": ["approximation algorithms", "network analysis", "social networks", "social network analysis", "polynomial-time algorithms", "betweenness", "degree centrality", "centrality measures", "optimization", "optimal solutions", "sna", "graph theory", "approximation theory", "electric network analysis", "world wide web", "polynomial approximation", "complex networks", "mathematics", "computer systems", "theoretical computer science", "electric network topology", "internet", "topology", "computer science", "telecommunication networks", "network topology", "telecommunication systems", "computer networks"], "doi": "", "authors": [{"country": "United States", "affiliation": "University of California, Santa Barbara", "name": "sourav medya", "id": 2342828630, "gridid": "grid.133342.4", "affiliationid": 154570441, "order": 2}, {"country": "India", "affiliation": "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur", "name": "palash dey", "id": 2123402177, "gridid": "grid.429017.9", "affiliationid": 145894827, "order": 1}], "cso_annotated": true, "grid_type": {"education": 100.0}, "type": "academia", "countries": {"united states": 50.0, "india": 50.0}, "citation_for_year": [{"citationcount": 1, "year": "2019-01-01"}]}

Massive datasets, however, pose a computational challenge for traditional algorithms, placing significant constraints on both memory and processing power. Recently, the powerful concept of randomness has been introduced as a strategy to ease the computational load. The essential idea of probabilistic algorithms is to employ some amount of randomness in order to derive a smaller matrix from a high-dimensional data matrix. The smaller matrix is then used to compute the desired low-rank approximation. Such algorithms are shown to be computationally efficient for approximating matrices with low-rank structure. We present the R package rsvd, and provide a tutorial introduction to randomized matrix decompositions.

While codata is not featured in many programming languages today, we show how codata can be easily adopted and implemented by offering simple inter-compilation techniques between data and codata.

However, adversarial machine learning has similarly advanced and has been used to demonstrate that VPSes are vulnerable to the injection of hidden commands - audio obscured by noise that is correctly recognized by a VPS but not by human beings. Such attacks, though, are often highly dependent on white-box knowledge of a specific machine learning model and limited to specific microphones and speakers, making their use across different acoustic hardware platforms (and thus their practicality) limited. In this paper, we break these dependencies and make hidden command attacks more practical through model-agnostic (blackbox) attacks, which exploit knowledge of the signal processing algorithms commonly used by VPSes to generate the data fed into machine learning systems. Specifically, we exploit the fact that multiple source audio samples have similar feature vectors when transformed by acoustic feature extraction algorithms (e.g., FFTs). We develop four classes of perturbations that create unintelligible audio and test them against 12 machine learning models, including 7 proprietary models (e.g., Google Speech API, Bing Speech API, IBM Speech API, Azure Speaker API, etc), and demonstrate successful attacks against all targets. Moreover, we successfully use our maliciously generated audio samples in multiple hardware configurations, demonstrating effectiveness across both models and real systems.

Past studies lack practicability in terms of both problem formulation and solution framework. On the one hand, some problem settings in prior online bipartite graph matching research are impractical for real-world applications. On the other hand, existing solutions to online bipartite graph matching are inefficient due to the unnecessary real-time decision making. In this paper, we propose the dynamic bipartite graph matching (DBGM) problem to be better aligned with real-world applications and devise a novel adaptive batch-based solution framework with a constant competitive ratio. As an effective and efficient implementation of the solution framework, we design a reinforcement learning based algorithm, called Restricted Q-learning (RQL), which makes near-optimal decisions on batch splitting. Extensive experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets show that our methods outperform the state-of-the-arts in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.", "conferenceseriesid": 1163988186, "confplace": "Macau SAR, China", "cso_syntactic_topics": ["competitive ratio", "bipartite graphs", "graph matching", "q-learning", "reinforcement learning approach", "reinforcement learning"], "urls": ["http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icde/icde2019.html#WangTLXXL19"], "cso_semantic_topics": ["bipartite graphs", "reinforcement learning", "reinforcement learning approach", "graph matching", "competitive ratio"], "confseriesname": "International Conference on Data Engineering", "id": 2952933729, "cso_enhanced_topics": ["competitive ratio", "bipartite graphs", "graph matching", "q-learning", "reinforcement learning approach", "reinforcement learning", "on-line algorithms", "graph theory", "pattern recognition", "machine learning", "online systems", "theoretical computer science", "artificial intelligence", "computer systems", "computer science"], "doi": "10.1109/ICDE.2019.00133", "authors": [{"country": "Singapore", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University", "name": "cheng long", "id": 2121257162, "gridid": "grid.59025.3b", "affiliationid": 172675005, "order": 3}, {"country": "China", "affiliation": "Beihang University", "name": "weifeng lv", "id": 2100670729, "gridid": "grid.64939.31", "affiliationid": 82880672, "order": 6}, {"country": "China", "affiliation": "Beihang University", "name": "ke xu", "id": 2600070012, "gridid": "grid.64939.31", "affiliationid": 82880672, "order": 5}, {"country": "China", "affiliation": "Beihang University", "name": "yansheng wang", "id": 2996769266, "gridid": "grid.64939.31", "affiliationid": 82880672, "order": 1}, {"name": "pan xu", "id": 2590070291, "affiliationid": 66946132, "order": 4}, {"country": "China", "affiliation": "Beihang University", "name": "yongxin tong", "id": 2114386387, "gridid": "grid.64939.31", "affiliationid": 82880672, "order": 2}], "cso_annotated": true, "grid_type": {"education": 100.0}, "type": "academia", "countries": {"singapore": 20.0, "china": 80.0}, "citation_for_year": [{"citationcount": 1, "year": "2019-01-01"}, {"citationcount": 3, "year": "2020-01-01"}]}

Participants in a federated learning process cooperatively train a model by exchanging model parameters instead of the actual training data, which they might want to keep private. However, parameter interaction and the resulting model still might disclose information about the training data used. To address these privacy concerns, several approaches have been proposed based on differential privacy and secure multiparty computation (SMC), among others. They often result in large communication overhead and slow training time. In this paper, we propose HybridAlpha, an approach for privacy-preserving federated learning employing an SMC protocol based on functional encryption.

In this paper, we adopted a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate unlabeled samples and enlarge the training set. A semi-supervised learning scheme with the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) was proposed accordingly, which assigns a uniform label distribution to the unlabeled images to regularize the supervised model and improve the performance of the vehicle re-ID system.

When sharing data to an extensive number of users with fuzzy identities, the data proprietor must use an appropriate identity-based encryption technique that satisfies both efficiency and security prerequisites. Identity-based encryption is a promising possibility to ensure fuzzy user data sharing while meeting the security essentials; however, it may encounter efficiency trouble in multi-receiver settings. Recently, identity-based encryption has received much attention, and most of the research has aimed to apply the technique in real-world systems. A major concern about using identity-based encryption is the safety of the private keys, as disclosure of secret keys requires the reissuing of encryptions already doled out. The capability to minimize the risks associated with key disclosure is particularly important due to the increased use of mobile and unprotected devices. In this article, we shall propose a forward-secure identity-based encryption technique based on subtree for fuzzy user data sharing under cloud computing environment, and we shall demonstrate that the technique is semantically secure against a chosen subtree and chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CST\u2013CCA). In addition, we will show the superiority of our new technique over the currently existing methods in terms of security and the length of public key.

To evaluate the effectiveness of this techniques on enhancing CAPTCHA security, they conducted a comprehensive field study and compared them to similar mechanisms. The comparison results demonstrated that the neural style transfer decreased the success rate of automated attacks.

Over the last two decades, the scientific community has introduced the use of other spatial structures in an attempt to represent the processes simulated by these models more realistically. Cadastre parcels are a good choice when simulating urban growth at local scales, where pixels or regular cells do not represent the geographic space properly. Furthermore, the implementation and calibration of key factors such as accessibility and suitability have not been sufficiently explored in models employing irregular structures. This paper presents a fully calibrated model to simulate urban growth: Model for Urban Growth simulation using Irregular Cellular Automata. The model uses the irregular structure of the cadastre and its smallest unit: the cadastral parcel. The factors included are based on the traditional Neighbourhood, Accessibility, Suitability and Zoning Status modelling schema, frequently employed in other models. Each factor was implemented and calibrated for the irregular structure employed by the model, and a new approach was explored to introduce a random component that would reproduce illegal growth. Several versions of Model for Urban Growth simulation using Irregular Cellular Automata were produced to calibrate the model within the period 2000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2010. The results obtained from the simulations were compared against observed growth for 2010, adapting the traditional confusion matrix to irregular space.

As data generation is a continuous process, this leads to ML model owners updating their models frequently with newly-collected data in an online learning scenario. In consequence, if an ML model is queried with the same set of data samples at two different points in time, it will provide different results.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we investigate whether the change in the output of a black-box ML model before and after being updated can leak information of the dataset used to perform the update, namely the updating set. This constitutes a new attack surface against black-box ML models and such information leakage may compromise the intellectual property and data privacy of the ML model owner. We propose four attacks following an encoder-decoder formulation, which allows inferring diverse information of the updating set.

Integrated Information Theory (IIT) has gained attention in this regard due to its theoretically strong framework. Nevertheless, it faces some limitations such as current state dependence, computational intractability and inability to be applied to real brain data. On the other hand, Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) is a clinical measure for distinguishing different levels of consciousness. Though PCI claims to capture the functional differentiation and integration in brain networks (similar to IIT), its link to integrated information is rather weak.

The detectors operate on measured sensor data, leveraging physical process models learned a priori. Evading detection by such systems is challenging, as an attacker needs to manipulate a constrained number of sensor readings in real-time with realistic perturbations according to the current state of the system. In this work, we propose a number of evasion attacks (with different assumptions on the attacker's knowledge), and compare the attacks' cost and efficiency against replay attacks. In particular, we show that a replay attack on a subset of sensor values can be detected easily as it violates physical constraints. In contrast, our proposed attacks leverage manipulated sensor readings that observe learned physical constraints of the system. Our proposed white box attacker uses an optimization approach with a detection oracle, while our black box attacker uses an autoencoder (or a convolutional neural network) to translate anomalous data into normal data. Our proposed approaches are implemented and evaluated on two different datasets pertaining to the domain of water distribution networks. We then demonstrated the efficacy of the real-time attack on a realistic testbed.

Those synthesised data are then augmented by deep generative neural networks through adversarial learning.

The proof is conducted by first proving the property for SCNNs from the strong law of large numbers, and then using SCNNs as a \u201cbridge\u201d to prove for BNNs. Besides the universal approximation property, we also derive an appropriate bound for bit length M in order to provide insights for the actual neural network implementations. Based on the universal approximation property, we further prove that SCNNs and BNNs exhibit the same energy complexity.

In this paper, we propose an approach to represent and reason about temporal relations between imprecise time intervals which are classical time intervals characterized by gradual beginnings and/or endings. It is mainly based on extending the Allen\u2019s interval algebra. It is not only suitable to express precise temporal interval relations (e.g., \u201cBefore\u201d) but also imprecise personalized ones (e.g., \u201cJust Before\u201d). Compared to related work, our imprecise relations are personalized, in the sense that they are not limited to a given number and their meanings are determined by a domain expert. For instance, the classic Allen\u2019s relation \u201cBefore\u201d may be generalized in 5 imprecise relations, where \u201cBefore(1)\u201d means \u201cjust before\u201d and gradually the time gap between the two intervals increases until \u201cBefore(5)\u201d which means \u201ctoo long before\u201d. Our imprecise personalized relations are based on our extension of the Vilain and Kautz\u2019s point algebra. We showed that, unlike most related work, our temporal interval relations preserve many of the properties of the Allen\u2019s interval algebra. Furthermore, we show how they can be used for temporal reasoning by means of a transitivity table. Finally, our approach is applied to the Semantic Web. We propose a fuzzy ontology-based prototype.

To this end, we provide a two-stage approach called MISC (Multiple Independent Subspace Clusterings). In the first stage, MISC uses independent subspace analysis to seek multiple and statistical independent (i.e. non-redundant) subspaces, and determines the number of subspaces via the minimum description length principle. In the second stage, to account for the intrinsic geometric structure of samples embedded in each subspace, MISC performs graph regularized semi-nonnegative matrix factorization to explore clusters. It additionally integrates the kernel trick into matrix factorization to handle non-linearly separable clusters.

The second attack specifically targets Variational Autoencoders, achieving high membership inference accuracy. Furthermore, previous work mostly considers membership inference adversaries who perform single record membership inference. We argue for considering regulatory actors who perform set membership inference to identify the use of specific datasets for training. The attacks are evaluated on two generative model architectures, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), trained on standard image datasets. Our results show that the two attacks yield success rates superior to previous work on most data sets while at the same time having only very mild assumptions. We envision the two attacks in combination with the membership inference attack type formalization as especially useful.

Yet suspected security bug reports are often publicly disclosed because the mislabelling issues ( i.e., mislabel security bug reports as not-security bug report). The goal of this paper is to aid software developers to better classify bug reports that identify security vulnerabilities as security bug reports through parameter tuning of learners and data pre-processor. Previous work has applied text analytics and machine learning learners to classify which reported bugs are security related. We improve on that work, as shown by our analysis of five open source projects. We apply hyperparameter optimization to (a)~the control parameters of a learner; and (b)~the data pre-processing methods that handle the case where the target class is a small fraction of all the data. We show that optimizing the pre-processor is more useful than optimizing the learners. We also show that improvements gained from our approach can be very large.

Motivated by improving the feasibility and scalability of data generation for system testing, we present a novel approach, whereby we employ a combination of metaheuristic search and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) for constraint solving. Our approach delegates constraint solving tasks to metaheuristic search and SMT in such a way as to take advantage of the complementary strengths of the two techniques. We ground our work on test data models specified in UML, with OCL used as the constraint language. We present tool support and an evaluation of our approach over three industrial case studies.

However, identifying relevant structures in unlabeled, high-dimensional data is nontrivial, requiring iterative experimentation with clustering parameters as well as data features and instances. The number of possible clusterings for a typical dataset is vast, and navigating in this vast space is also challenging. The absence of ground-truth labels makes it impossible to define an optimal solution, thus requiring user judgment to establish what can be considered a satisfiable clustering result. Data scientists need adequate interactive tools to effectively explore and navigate the large clustering space so as to improve the effectiveness of exploratory clustering analysis. We introduce  Clustrophile 2 , a new interactive tool for guided clustering analysis.  Clustrophile 2  guides users in clustering-based exploratory analysis, adapts user feedback to improve user guidance, facilitates the interpretation of clusters, and helps quickly reason about differences between clusterings. To this end,  Clustrophile 2  contributes a novel feature, the Clustering Tour, to help users choose clustering parameters and assess the quality of different clustering results in relation to current analysis goals and user expectations. We evaluate  Clustrophile 2  through a user study with 12 data scientists, who used our tool to explore and interpret sub-cohorts in a dataset of Parkinson's disease patients.

We describe a fast model-based fault localisation algorithm that, given a test suite, uses symbolic execution methods to fully automatically identify a small subset of program locations where genuine program repairs exist. Our algorithm iterates over failing test cases and collects locations where an assignment change can repair exhibited faulty behaviour. Our main contribution is an improved search through the test suite, reducing the effort for the symbolic execution of the models and leading to speed-ups of more than two orders of magnitude over the previously published implementation by Griesmayer et al. We implemented our algorithm for C programs, using the KLEE symbolic execution engine, and demonstrate its effectiveness on the Siemens TCAS variants. Its performance is in line with recent alternative model-based fault localisation techniques, but narrows the location set further without rejecting any genuine repair locations where faults can be fixed by changing a single assignment. We also show how our tool can be used in an educational context to improve self-guided learning and accelerate assessment. We apply our algorithm to a large selection of actual student coursework submissions, providing precise localisation within a sub-second response time. We show this using small test suites, already provided in the coursework management system, and on expanded test suites, demonstrating the scalability of our approach. We also show compliance with test suites does not reliably grade a class of \u201calmost-correct\u201d submissions, which our tool highlights, as being close to the correct answer.

Compared with the traditional proxy re-encryption, AP-PRE provides much better fine-grained access control to delegation path. Briefly speaking, in an AP-PRE scheme, the delegator designates a path of his preferred delegatees. The path consists of several delegatees with the privilege from high to low. If the delegatee in the path cannot complete the decryption, the decryption right is automatically delegated to the next one in the path. In this way, the delegator can ensure that the delegation has always been done among those delegatees the delegator trusts. Moreover, an AP-PRE scheme has to obey the following path rules. The delegation, for ciphertexts of a delegator $i$i, can only be carried out on the autonomous path $\\mathsf {Pa}_i$Pai designated by the delegator $i$i, in the sense that (1) re-encrypted ciphertexts along the autonomous path $\\mathsf {Pa}_i$Pai cannot branch off $\\mathsf {Pa}_i$Pai with meaningful decryption, and (2) original ciphertexts generated under $pk_j$pkj for $j \\ne i$j\u2260i (i.e., for a path $\\mathsf {Pa}_j$Paj different from $\\mathsf {Pa}_i$Pai) cannot be inserted into (i.e., cannot be transformed along) the autonomous path $\\mathsf {Pa}_i$Pai with meaningful decryption. We give the formal definition, as well as the formal security model, for this cryptographic primitive.

We find that community embedding is not only useful for community-level applications such as graph visualization but also provide an exciting opportunity to improve community detection and node classification. Specifically, we consider the interaction between community embedding and detection as a closed loop, through node embedding. On the one hand, node embedding can improve community detection since the detected communities are used to fit a community embedding. On the other hand, community embedding can be used to optimize node embedding by introducing a community-aware high-order proximity. However, in practice, the number of communities can be unknown beforehand; thus we extend our previous Community Embedding (ComE) model. We propose ComE+, a new model which handles both: the unknown truth community assignments and the unknown number of communities present in the dataset. We further develop an efficient inference algorithm for ComE+ for keeping complexity low. Our extensive evaluation shows that ComE+ improves the state-of-the-art baselines in various application tasks, e.g., community detection and node classification.", "cso_syntactic_topics": ["graph visualization", "inference algorithm", "community detection", "graph embeddings"], "urls": ["https://experts.illinois.edu/en/publications/embedding-both-finite-and-infinite-communities-on-graphs-applicat", "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8764640/"], "cso_semantic_topics": ["visualization", "graph visualization", "community detection", "classification models", "inference", "inference algorithm", "detection algorithm", "directed graphs", "weighted graph", "community detection algorithms", "probabilistic inference", "online communities", "social networks", "embedding process", "intermediate node", "destination nodes"], "id": 2964093663, "journame": "ieee computational intelligence magazine", "cso_enhanced_topics": ["detection algorithm", "classification models", "social networks", "graph embeddings", "intermediate node", "community detection", "destination nodes", "graph visualization", "inference algorithm", "probabilistic inference", "online communities", "embedding process", "visualization", "directed graphs", "inference", "weighted graph", "community detection algorithms", "signal detection", "classification methods", "world wide web", "graph theory", "wireless networks", "ad hoc networks", "sensor networks", "wireless sensor networks", "network coding", "routing protocols", "complex networks", "information visualization", "graphic methods", "inference engines", "bayesian networks", "probability distributions", "online systems", "image watermarking", "steganography", "human computer interaction", "signal processing", "computer systems", "internet", "theoretical computer science", "wireless communications", "packet networks", "routers", "mobile telecommunication systems", "internet protocols", "quality of service", "wireless local area networks (wlan)", "multicasts", "routing algorithms", "sensors", "wireless telecommunication systems", "embedded systems", "energy utilization", "sensor nodes", "information theory", "topology", "interactive computer graphics", "information analysis", "graphical user interfaces", "data visualization", "artificial intelligence", "probability", "watermarking algorithms", "security of data", "cryptography", "computer science", "engineering", "computer networks", "telecommunication traffic", "bandwidth", "communication channels (information theory)", "telecommunication networks", "local area networks", "data communication systems", "computer hardware", "communication systems", "telecommunication systems", "electricity", "communication", "user interfaces", "computer imaging and vision", "database systems", "information systems", "mathematics", "digital watermarking", "computer security", "cryptology", "image processing"], "doi": "10.1109/MCI.2019.2919396", "authors": [{"country": "Singapore", "affiliation": "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "name": "hongyun cai", "id": 2121653533, "gridid": "grid.185448.4", "affiliationid": 115228651, "order": 3}, {"country": "Singapore", "affiliation": "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "name": "vincent w zheng", "id": 2603370895, "gridid": "grid.185448.4", "affiliationid": 115228651, "order": 5}, {"country": "Singapore", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University", "name": "sandro cavallari", "id": 2547861786, "gridid": "grid.59025.3b", "affiliationid": 172675005, "order": 1}, {"country": "Singapore", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University", "name": "erik cambria", "id": 2806062742, "gridid": "grid.59025.3b", "affiliationid": 172675005, "order": 2}, {"country": "United States", "affiliation": "University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign", "name": "kevin chenchuan chang", "id": 2096749051, "gridid": "grid.35403.31", "affiliationid": 157725225, "order": 4}], "cso_annotated": true, "grid_type": {"government": 40.0, "education": 60.0}, "countries": {"singapore": 80.0, "united states": 20.0}, "citation_for_year": [{"citationcount": 1, "year": "2020-01-01"}]}

We conclude that: (1) the weights of the early layers of deep networks contain limited information about the statistics of natural images, that (2) such low-level statistics can be learned through self-supervision just as well as through strong supervision, and that (3) the low-level statistics can be captured via synthetic transformations instead of using a large image dataset.", "cso_syntactic_topics": ["correlation analysis", "neural networks", "single images", "data augmentation"], "urls": ["https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13132"], "cso_semantic_topics": ["correlation analysis", "network architecture", "neural networks", "data augmentation", "reference image", "color images", "digital image"], "id": 2989731761, "journame": "arxiv computer vision and pattern recognition", "cso_enhanced_topics": ["data augmentation", "reference image", "color images", "digital image", "correlation analysis", "network architecture", "single images", "neural networks", "bayesian analysis", "image matching", "image quality", "pattern recognition", "color image processing", "image analysis", "image processing", "mathematics", "computer networks", "face recognition", "image segmentation", "machine learning", "bayes theorem", "computer imaging and vision", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "probability"], "doi": "", "authors": [{"country": "United Kingdom", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "name": "yuki markus asano", "id": 2943049934, "gridid": "grid.4991.5", "affiliationid": 40120149, "order": 1}, {"country": "United Kingdom", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "name": "andrea vedaldi", "id": 332962150, "gridid": "grid.4991.5", "affiliationid": 40120149, "order": 3}, {"country": "United Kingdom", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "name": "christian rupprecht", "id": 2251807875, "gridid": "grid.4991.5", "affiliationid": 40120149, "order": 2}], "cso_annotated": true, "grid_type": {"education": 100.0}, "type": "academia", "countries": {"united kingdom": 100.0}, "citation_for_year": [{"citationcount": 1, "year": "2020-01-01"}]}

We show that an extension of the InsideOut algorithm using Chazelle's geometric data structure for solving the semigroup range search problem can answer Boolean FAQ-AI in time given by these new width parameters. This new algorithm achieves lower complexity than known solutions for FAQ-AI. It also recovers some known results in database query answering. Our second contribution is a relaxation of the set of polymatroids that gives rise to the counting version of the submodular width, denoted by #subw. This new width is sandwiched between the submodular and the fractional hypertree widths. Any FAQ and FAQ-AI over one semiring can be answered in time proportional to #subw and respectively to the relaxed version of #subw.

Such inputs contain small perturbations to intentionally fool the attacked model. \r\nIn this paper, we present a novel end-to-end framework to detect such attacks during classification without influencing the target model's performance. Inspired by recent research in neuron-coverage guided testing we show that dense layers of DNNs carry security-sensitive information.

Thereby, we cover a variety of target DNNs, including Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architectures. In addition, to effectively defend against state-of-the-art attacks, our approach generalizes between different sets of adversarial examples.

In this paper, we consider how formal verification techniques developed for traditional software systems can be repurposed for verification of reinforcement learning-enabled ones, a particularly important class of machine learning systems. Rather than enforcing safety by examining and altering the structure of a complex neural network implementation, our technique uses blackbox methods to synthesizes deterministic programs, simpler, more interpretable, approximations of the network that can nonetheless guarantee desired safety properties are preserved, even when the network is deployed in unanticipated or previously unobserved environments. Our methodology frames the problem of neural network verification in terms of a counterexample and syntax-guided inductive synthesis procedure over these programs. The synthesis procedure searches for both a deterministic program and an inductive invariant over an infinite state transition system that represents a specification of an application's control logic. Additional specifications defining environment-based constraints can also be provided to further refine the search space.

Common across these proposals is the idea of embedding code and natural language queries into real vectors and then using vector distance to approximate semantic correlation between code and the query. Multiple approaches exist for learning these embeddings, including unsupervised techniques, which rely only on a corpus of code examples, and supervised techniques, which use an aligned corpus of paired code and natural language descriptions. The goal of this supervision is to produce embeddings that are more similar for a query and the corresponding desired code snippet.     Clearly, there are choices in whether to use supervised techniques at all, and if one does, what sort of network and training to use for supervision. This paper is the first to evaluate these choices systematically. To this end, we assembled implementations of state-of-the-art techniques to run on a common platform, training and evaluation corpora. To explore the design space in network complexity, we also introduced a new design point that is a minimal supervision extension to an existing unsupervised technique.     Our evaluation shows that: 1. adding supervision to an existing unsupervised technique can improve performance, though not necessarily by much; 2. simple networks for supervision can be more effective that more sophisticated sequence-based networks for code search; 3. while it is common to use docstrings to carry out supervision, there is a sizeable gap between the effectiveness of docstrings and a more query-appropriate supervision corpus.", "conferenceseriesid": 1199533187, "confplace": "Tallinn, Estonia", "cso_syntactic_topics": ["natural languages", "semantics", "natural language queries", "deep learning", "neural networks"], "urls": ["http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03813.pdf", "http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1905.html#abs-1905-03813"], "cso_semantic_topics": ["deep learning", "network architecture", "neural networks", "natural languages", "natural language queries", "semantics", "keyword queries", "binary codes", "code generation", "source codes", "natural language text", "natural language questions", "query results", "query processing", "structured queries", "unsupervised learning"], "confseriesname": "Foundations of Software Engineering", "id": 2968179027, "cso_enhanced_topics": ["natural languages", "semantics", "natural language queries", "source codes", "keyword queries", "network architecture", "query processing", "unsupervised learning", "natural language questions", "binary codes", "deep learning", "query results", "structured queries", "code generation", "neural networks", "natural language text", "linguistics", "query languages", "software engineering", "keyword search", "computer networks", "search engines", "clustering algorithms", "question answering", "information theory", "program compilers", "machine learning", "natural language processing", "database systems", "computer science", "world wide web", "data mining", "computational linguistics", "information retrieval", "communication", "parallel processing systems", "computer programming languages", "artificial intelligence", "computer systems", "internet", "distributed systems", "computer programming", "distributed computer systems"], "doi": "10.1145/3338906.3340458", "authors": [{"country": "Israel", "affiliation": "Facebook (Israel)", "name": "satish chandra", "id": 2915299349, "gridid": "grid.474390.d", "affiliationid": 2252078561, "order": 5}, {"country": "United States", "affiliation": "University of California, Berkeley", "name": "koushik sen", "id": 2157836386, "gridid": "grid.47840.3f", "affiliationid": 95457486, "order": 4}, {"country": "United States", "affiliation": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "name": "jose pablo cambronero", "id": 2776754650, "gridid": "grid.116068.8", "affiliationid": 63966007, "order": 1}, {"country": "Israel", "affiliation": "Facebook (Israel)", "name": "seohyun kim", "id": 2806385192, "gridid": "grid.474390.d", "affiliationid": 2252078561, "order": 3}, {"country": "Israel", "affiliation": "Facebook (Israel)", "name": "hongyu li", "id": 2805694884, "gridid": "grid.474390.d", "affiliationid": 2252078561, "order": 2}], "cso_annotated": true, "grid_type": {"company": 60.0, "education": 40.0}, "type": "collaborative", "countries": {"israel": 60.0, "united states": 40.0}, "dbpedia_categories": ["Internet"], "industrial_sectors": ["computing_and_it", "technology"], "citation_for_year": [{"citationcount": 1, "year": "2019-01-01"}]}

Failures of such systems can lead to loss of life or property, which necessitates stringent verification and validation for providing high assurance. Though formal verification approaches are being investigated, testing remains the primary technique for assessing the dependability of such systems. Due to the nature of the tasks handled by DNNs, the cost of obtaining test oracle data---the expected output, a.k.a. label, for a given input---is high, which significantly impacts the amount and quality of testing that can be performed. Thus, prioritizing input data for testing DNNs in meaningful ways to reduce the cost of labeling can go a long way in increasing testing efficacy. This paper proposes using gauges of the DNN's sentiment derived from the computation performed by the model, as a means to identify inputs that are likely to reveal weaknesses. We empirically assessed the efficacy of three such sentiment measures for prioritization---confidence, uncertainty, and surprise---and compare their effectiveness in terms of their fault-revealing capability and retraining effectiveness.

We introduce the model of Data Transducers to allow modular compilation of queries over streaming data. A data transducer maintains a finite set of data variables and processes a sequence of tagged data values by updating its variables using an allowed set of operations. The model allows unambiguous nondeterminism, exponentially succinct control, and combining values from parallel threads of computation. The semantics of the model immediately suggests an efficient streaming algorithm for evaluation. The expressiveness of data transducers coincides with streamable regular transductions, a robust and streamable class of functions characterized by MSO-definable string-to-DAG transformations with no backward edges. We show that the novel features of data transducers, unlike previously studied transducers, make them as succinct as traditional imperative code for processing data streams, but the structuring of the transition function permits modular compilation. In particular, we show that operations such as parallel composition, union, prefix-sum, and quantitative analogs of combinators for unambiguous parsing, can be implemented by natural and succinct constructions on data transducers. To illustrate the benefits of such modularity in compilation, we define a new language for quantitative monitoring, QRE-Past, that integrates features of past-time temporal logic and quantitative regular expressions.

In this paper, we study basic counting problems in the shuffled model and establish separations between the error that can be achieved in the single-message shuffled model and in the shuffled model with multiple messages per user. For the frequency estimation problem with $n$ users and for a domain of size $B$, we obtain: \r\n- A nearly tight lower bound of $\\tilde{\\Omega}( \\min(n^{1/4}, \\sqrt{B}))$ on the error in the single-message shuffled model. This implies that the protocols obtained from the amplification via shuffling work of Erlingsson et al. (SODA 2019) and Balle et al. (Crypto 2019) are essentially optimal for single-message protocols. \r\n- A nearly tight lower bound of $\\Omega\\left(\\frac{\\log{B}}{\\log\\log{B}}\\right)$ on the sample complexity with constant relative error in the single-message shuffled model. This improves on the lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log^{1/17} B)$ obtained by Cheu et al. (Eurocrypt 2019). \r\n- Protocols in the multi-message shuffled model with $\\mathrm{poly}(\\log{B}, \\log{n})$ bits of communication per user and $\\mathrm{poly}\\log{B}$ error, which provide an exponential improvement on the error compared to what is possible with single-message algorithms. \r\nFor the related selection problem, we also show a nearly tight sample complexity lower bound of $\\Omega(B)$ in the single-message shuffled model. This improves on the $\\Omega(B^{1/17})$ lower bound obtained by Cheu et al. (Eurocrypt 2019), and when combined with their $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{B})$-error multi-message algorithm, implies the first separation between single-message and multi-message protocols for this problem.", "cso_syntactic_topics": ["frequency estimation", "communication", "differential privacies"], "urls": ["https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11358", "http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1908.11358", "http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1908.11358"], "cso_semantic_topics": ["anonymous communication", "privacy", "differential privacies", "frequency estimation", "communication", "trust relationship", "hierarchical model", "sms messages", "communication protocols"], "id": 2990554372, "journame": "arxiv cryptography and security", "cso_enhanced_topics": ["communication", "communication protocols", "trust relationship", "sms messages", "privacy", "frequency estimation", "anonymous communication", "hierarchical model", "differential privacies", "network protocols", "trust management", "social networks", "sms", "short message services", "computer security", "frequency allocation", "anonymity", "communication systems", "hierarchical system", "privacy preserving", "sensitive informations", "database systems", "internet", "computer networks", "access control", "security systems", "network security", "distributed computer systems", "world wide web", "telephone sets", "global system for mobile communications", "mobile devices", "mobile phones", "computer science", "communication channels (information theory)", "telecommunication traffic", "data communication systems", "authentication", "computer systems", "data mining", "security of data", "cryptography", "mobile computing", "mobile telecommunication systems", "computer hardware", "wireless telecommunication systems", "telecommunication networks", "cryptology", "telecommunication systems"], "doi": "", "authors": [{"country": "United States", "affiliation": "Google (United States)", "name": "ameya velingker", "id": 2949071036, "gridid": "grid.420451.6", "affiliationid": 1291425158, "order": 5}, {"name": "ravi kumar", "id": 2971018601, "order": 3}, {"name": "badih ghazi", "id": 2134571798, "order": 1}, {"country": "Denmark", "affiliation": "IT University of Copenhagen", "name": "rasmus pagh", "id": 1864519460, "gridid": "grid.32190.39", "affiliationid": 83467386, "order": 4}, {"country": "United States", "affiliation": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "name": "noah golowich", "id": 2617971007, "gridid": "grid.116068.8", "affiliationid": 63966007, "order": 2}], "cso_annotated": true, "grid_type": {"company": 33.333333333333336, "education": 66.66666666666667}, "type": "collaborative", "countries": {"united states": 66.66666666666667, "denmark": 33.333333333333336}, "dbpedia_categories": ["Software", "Internet"], "industrial_sectors": ["computing_and_it", "technology"], "citation_for_year": [{"citationcount": 2, "year": "2020-01-01"}]}
